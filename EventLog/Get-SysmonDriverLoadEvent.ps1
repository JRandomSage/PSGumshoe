    .SYNOPSIS
        Get Sysmon DNS Query events (EventId 6).
    .DESCRIPTION
        The driver loaded events provides information about a driver being loaded on the system. 
        The configured hashes are provided as well as signature information. The signature is 
        created asynchronously for performance reasons and indicates if the file was removed 
        after loading.
